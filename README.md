# Grapher
A Python Class to easily create , modify and analyse Graphs ( Data Structure ) .

####Some Features :
>1. Properly documented.
>2. Includes a Shortest Path Finder ( based on Dijkstra's algorithm )


####How to use : 
  1. Create a graph
  > 
  ```python
      g = Graph( No_Of_Nodes )
  ```
    
  2. Add an edge
  > 
  ```python
      g.addEdge( _from , _to , weight )
  ```
  
  3. Find Shortest Paths from a node
  >
  ```python
      g.PathFinder( source node no. )
  ```

_I have tried my best to make this code bug-free , but it may still have some of them hidden deep down . I would appreciate your efforts in finding them ._ :v:
